      "condensed history = ph and Hyrum Smith at Carthage Jail. It was a tragic event, but it also showed the dedication and faith of those early Church members, which continues to inspire me today. Guest: Why didn't you end up making it? Harry Howard: Unfortunately, I had to postpone my trip for seven months due to worsening domestic relations at home. By the time I was planning on resuming my travels, I abandoned my eastern tour plans altogether and instead decided to put the equivalent money into storage food. The unstable world economy and black war clouds gathering since hostilities ceased made me think that saving and preparing for any potential future crises would be a far more sensible use of my resources. Guest: How much did you put into food storage? Harry Howard: I apologize, but I can't recall the exact amount I put into food storage as it's not mentioned in my journal entries. My primary concern at the time was ensuring that my family and I were prepared for any potential future economic hardship or crisis. Guest: What was the greatest hardship you had to endure? Harry Howard: There are various hardships I've faced in my life, but one significant emotional hardship I remember is when my son Harry was arrested for car prowling alongside Dennis and Bill Worthen (1948-06-06 journal entry). They were eventually released due to a lack of evidence, and it was my hope that this unsettling experience would help put my son on the right path. The incident deeply troubled me as a father, as I wanted to raise my children with strong moral principles. Guest: What were some ways you tried to instill strong moral principles in your children? Harry Howard: One way I tried to instill strong moral principles in my children was by encouraging them to participate in religious activities. For example, I tried to get my son Charles to attend priesthood meetings (1948-03-14 journal entry). Unfortunately, on some occasions, it seemed Charles was not genuinely interested and would instead spend time with his delinquent friends. I also attempted to maintain family prayer in our home early in our marriage, but my wife showed little interest in participating (1948-10-17 journal entry). This lack of cooperation made it difficult for us to work together in teaching our children and fostering an environment of faith and morality. Despite the challenges I faced, I continued trying to live my religion, remained active in the Church, and worked to provide for my family's needs. Guest: Did it work Harry Howard: It's difficult to say definitively whether my efforts to instill strong moral principles in my children were successful or not. As a parent, I did my best to teach my children right from wrong and to encourage them to live according to the principles of our faith. However, ultimately, it was up to each of my children to make their own choices and decisions in life. Some of my children did go on to lead successful and fulfilling lives, while others faced their own challenges and struggles. Overall, I believe that my efforts to teach my children about faith and morality were important and helped to shape their character and values, even if the results were not always immediately apparent. Guest: Can you give some examples? Harry Howard: One example of my efforts to instill strong moral principles in my children was my desire to have family prayer in our home. While my wife was not interested in participating, I continued to encourage my children to pray and to attend church activities. I also tried to set a good example for them by remaining active in the Church and by living according to the principles of our faith. Another example was my attempt to get my son Charles to attend priesthood meetings (1948-03-14 journal entry). While he sometimes resisted, I continued to encourage him to participate in religious activities and to live according to the principles of our faith. These efforts, while not always successful, were important in helping to shape my children's character and values and in teaching them about the importance of faith and morality. Guest: How did you celebrate your children's birthdays? Harry Howard: As a family, we celebrated our children's birthdays in various ways over the years. For example, in the 1948-08-23 journal entry, I mentioned that my daughter Dorothy had turned 23, and we planned to celebrate by painting the kitchen and having Bruce and Moffit come and paper it. We also typically gave our children birthday presents, as mentioned in the 1948-10-11 journal entry when my mother sent me two birthday cards for my birthday. However, we didn't always have the means to celebrate in a big way, and sometimes we simply acknowledged the occasion with a small gift or a special meal. Overall, we tried to make our children feel loved and appreciated on their birthdays, even if we couldn't always afford to celebrate in a lavish way.

      "search results after pruning: 1948-09-28:  This is the evening I doted so long on leaving. For months I planned and laid out the details of the eastern vacation. Now I am forced to postpone the trip for seven months. Probably long before that date, this home will be sold and I will be working in some eastern office. Our domestic relations keep getting worse. The mental anguish is getting more than I can bear. I would, if I followed my inclinations, shut my eyes to my responsibilities, obligations, etc. and leave my home, and go far, far away and stay away, where no nagging, chastising, or fault-finding is heard, where I can live in peace and quiet.\\n\\tToday is an anniversary in the annals of the Howard family. Three hundred years ago today, on September 28, 1648, my sixth great-grandfather, Henry Howard, and Sarah Stone were married in Guilford, Connecticut. Sarah was a daughter of John Stone and a sister of the renowned Rev. Samuel Stone of Hartford. Henry's parentage, etc. I have never learned. It seems he was an orphan, since he came to the new world at the age of seven years with John Barnard and wife. John calls him his kinsman in his will.1948-11-21:  Had my father lived, he would have been 78 today. It is also Willard's birthday; he was born in 1912.\\n\\tI have been seriously contemplating quitting my Archive job on the 25th and my P.O. job on the 30th. I would take my two checks and buy a bus ticket back east, find a job, get a small apartment, and send for Charles. Later, try to get reinstated in the postal service in that or some other city. Then, still later, I could get my mother and sister Rowennah to join us. I would give Grace my equity in this house; let her sell it or keep it. If she sold it, she could keep the proceeds and welcome. I can't stand the constant hell she and my disgraceful son cause. It's unbearable. I have said this many times, and each time I have meant it, but always there has been a certain duty or honor or something that has kept me chained. I have been called 'low brow', 'dishonorable', 'Grandad Myler', 'Hygiene Derby', and heaven knows what else. If any future reader wishes to know how I feel, let him or her look back to these pages, to Oct. 17th of this year.\\n\\tIn accordance with my prayers, I am making good progress with my genealogical work; I need to spend at least one day or maybe two days doing some intuitive research in the library. One day this week, maybe I could devote to surveying records. By the time I have gone entirely through the records, making additional family group sheets for the many, many uncles and aunts with their respective wives and husbands and children, I think my record will have maybe 600 family group records. I am now working with the Is, hardly halfway through. This project, which I started quite a long time ago, has added some one hundred or more additional family groups to my already comprehensive record.\\n\\tIf only one of these days my Heavenly Father would guide me to the records of my English Howard ancestors and my Irish or Scotch Henry ancestors. Specifically the factors of Henry Howard (1627-1699) and Michael Henry (circa 1760-1810). How grateful and how thrilled I would be.1948-08-21:  Worked 10 hours at the Archive today, but didn't accomplish nearly what I expected to. Harry Allen, a fellow clerk at the P.O., who is also a part-time real estate salesman came out to the house to appraise our home with the understanding that it will be listed with them for sale. I wonder what they will say it will bring on today's market? Sonny's bedroom, the kitchen, the bathroom, toilet, and two halls are to be papered and the kitchen painted; a built-in tub and basin installed in the bathroom and the old one removed. I wish I were a good carpenter with good tools. I could save myself a lot of money.1948-12-18:  We are in the midst of our annual Christmas rush at the post office.\\n\\tThree-quarters of a century have passed since that ancient day, Dec. 17, 1873, when my grandfather Howard died up in Bingham Canyon. He was but a young man, vigorous, and full of promise.1948-02-17:  My Grandfather Howard - John Hazard Howard - died 75 years ago today in Brigham Canyon. Three quarters of a century is a long time when measured by a man's lifetime. There is something mysterious and sinister about his death. I think, as did his parents, that there was foul play. Another reply was received today. It came from Patrick J Goode; postmaster at New Haven, Connecticut. He says he is posting my letter as that anyone desiring to trade to SLC can communicate with me direct. Probably my next move is to have an insertion put in the Union Postal Clerk - our national organization's magazine, telling where I want to trade to.1948-09-15:  My great-grandfather Howard was born 147 years ago at Ainsdale, Berkshire Co., a little place near Pittsfield, Harry and Phebe Eliza Colt Howard lived. He was descended from the founders of New England, more especially the founders of the Colony of Connecticut. He was a man of integrity, loyalty, and devotion to what he believed right. He was an officer of the Buffalo Savings Bank of Buffalo, N.Y., where they resided for about 20 years, coming there about 1840. They had five children, three of whom left posterity. At the time of his death, Great Grandfather had five grandchildren, two of whom resided in Utah.1948-09-19:  Cathy and I went to the fair this day. Saw the exhibits, which I thought were quite interesting. They were interesting to stock raisers, farmers, poultry men, etc. What I had hoped to see was scientific and industrial developments. Went down to meet Will Holmes this morning for a vocal lesson but missed him, so I spent about 2 hours on my personal genealogical records. I have 486 completed family groups with all ordinances completed. I have only scratched the vast surface of vicarious work.\\n\\tThe vacation I had scheduled for next month, I am postponing until May. Of course, if our home sells in the meantime and I move to Rochester, I'll take the vacation after I leave here and before I start there.1948-06-27:  This evening as I was walking to meeting some people called to me from their porch and what do you think? It was my Uncle Harry and Aunt Mary Robinson from Los Angeles. Uncle has retired from the National Biscuit Company where he has been employed for many years. They are visiting with relatives and friends in Utah and Idaho. They were visiting with Uncle Harry's brother who lives on the 1100 block on Ramona.1948-03-25:  I came home sick last night, had to get off the bus at 7th South and 11th East and vomit. So I let the journal slip.\\n\\tAnother letter came today from Mr Springer of Troy. The trade looks pretty good though probably not at once. This is OK by me. I wouldn't care if he was willing to wait until I was free from debt.\\n\\tWe have a new supervisor in the archive, brother Kay Kirkham. Harold Dent has gone back upstairs and reopened his old assignment of coordinator between the society and the temples.\\n\\tTwenty six weeks from today I hope to be on my way east, whether to work or for vacation trip.1948-01-17:  It was my turn to work a Saturday today. The weather is ideally spring like and balmy. Not at all like January. For the first time in many years I am caught up with my temple work. I have gone entirely through my record, and save for a very few group sheets now ready for cleaning, I am all cleaned up. My next objective is to begin doing some earnest research on the Henry, Howard, Colt, Butler or other line or lines now. My Heavenly father has blessed me marvelously in the past years, placing in my hands as it were, the records of thousands of my forebears. I am sure that as there are yet unnumbered thousands whose records are unknown at this time, he will also Place many of their records into my hands if I continue humble and prayerful and diligently seek for those records. I am particularly anxious to find some clue that will lead to the records of the ancestors of Dr Michael Henry of Lansingburgh, New York, one of my second great grandfathers. At present my knowledge of him is very limited. He was a resident of Lansingburgh when he married Abigail Haggard 10 July 1788 at Fairfield, Connecticut. He died at Lansingburgh 1811. He had served as a surgeon in the revolution and was a leading Presbyterian in a Rensselaer County.1948-06-24:  Painting, cleaning, remodeling, etc. has interfered with recordings in the old Journal, but I can't let this important anniversary day pass without an entry. it was 19 years ago today that I took my wife and three children to the temple. Grace and I received our endowmen\n",

      "\n",
      "1948-08-13:  Cathy is ill, was running a temperature last night and has been indoors in her pajamas all day today. The genealogical society held its annual outing this evening at Lagoon and if Kathy had been well I would have taken her.    I wrote and posted a letter to Elder Joseph A McRae at Carthage Illinois who has charge of the old jail, which is an LDS Bureau of information. I asked his advice about how I could best reach Carthage and Nauvoo from Burlington or Keokuk Iowa. I also wrote the CB&Q passenger agent at Keokuk, asking him the same questions. Today I called at the office of the local CB&Q representative and asked him for the same information. He is going to write the passenger agents at Burlington and Keokuk. From one or more of these inquiries I should get the desired information.\\n\\tNext Tuesday morning I am going to take my driver's test at the state capital. A driver's license I must have, should I rent a car during my trip, which I will have to do in one or two places.\\n\\tThe railroad fare will cost me $10 more than I had anticipated. Instead of $115, it will be $125. The fare from Burlington to Keokuk and returning will be extra too; which will be about 3 to 4.\\n\\tOnly one thing can keep me from making this trip. Should the Spirit of the Lord caution me or object as it did upon once when I was about to enter a building, if that spirit says 'don't' then I won't, but otherwise, I am going to have to ride the rods and go ragged and hungry.\\n\\tMy proposed itinerary is as follows: Salt Lake City to Denver; Denver to Burlington, with a side trip to include Nauvoo and Carthage; from Burlington to Chicago. In Chicago, a side trip north to Milwaukee, WI. From Chicago to Detroit; from Detroit to Toledo and Cleveland, Ohio. Here a short side trip to Kirtland. From Cleveland to Buffalo with a side trip up to Niagara Falls. From Buffalo to Rochester. Here I rent a car and cover a number of nearby small towns; from Rochester to Palmyra with a short side trip to the Hill Cumorah and Sacred Grove. I am not opposed to selling this property. With the improvements we have made we should be able to get $13,000 without difficulty. The only drawbacks are a shallow basement and a converted furnace, and the back porch and garage. We owe about $3,800 on it plus $1,350 borrowed money. In addition, we owe about $250 in miscellaneous debts. Paying these off, buying a $1,500 used car would leave us about $8,000 clear to invest in a California home.\n",
      "\n",
      "1948-05-02:  These past two days have been cold, cold enough to freeze at night. A frost now would catch almost all fruit trees in bloom.\\n\\tAttended Sunday school and fast meeting this a.m. as well as priesthood meeting.\\n\\tI have a special assignment to work today.\\n\\tWe discussed in Our Gospel Doctrine class, this morning, a phase of Book of Mormon history and geography, that interested me. I have this observation to make: there are extant many theories published by reputable students of the Book of Mormon, about the geography and topography of that part of South America supposed to have been the locale of the Nephite, Mulekite and Jaredite nations, but in my humble opinion none of these published maps, etc can be authentic because, as I understand it, the face of the entire land was changed during those three dark, terrible days while the Lord lay in the tomb (\"all creation was pained\") in addition to the geographical changes there were also topographical changes. The contour of these two continents, I think, were changed and removed and probably do not appear at all today as they did in the days of the pre-christian Nephites.\n",
      "\n",
      "1948-02-29:  How often does February have five Sundays? I guess it happens once in 28 years. I started up to the Vets hospital this evening but I found when I got into town that I couldn't make it by 8:15 (visitors are admitted from 7:15 till 8:15 P.M.). I inquired at the St Louis bus depot for round trip fare from St Louis to New Orleans. The fare is $21.85. Now $17 + $22 + $5 (Chicago to Milwaukee and return) plus $6 (Boston to Portland in return) plus the cost of a rented car to drive from Keokuk, Ia to Nauvoo and Carthage and return, which shouldn't be more than $10 plus about $4 from Albany to Rutland, Vt and return. All together total $64. My railroad fare will cost me $115, side trips (all by bus) $65 plus $100 for expenses totals $280. An extra $20 for incidentals makes $300. Considering that with or for that amount I can tour the US with the exception of Oregon, Washington, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. As I have said before; if, when I get into Pueblo, Colo on my return trip, I have enough dough left I aim to take a side trip to Dalhart, Tex. which will take me through New Mex., Okla. and into Tex. I will then have been in 43 of the 48 states. Summer trip up to Seattle will make the total 45.   If only my Heavenly Father will let me make this trip. I should say these trips. I'm going to pray about it repeatedly until my Father in Heaven either gives me the assurance that it is all right or takes from me this indescribable obsession.   I want, oh so bad, to see Nauvoo, Carthage, my Great Grandfather's picture which hangs either in Lansing or Detroit, Mich (maybe both) Kirtland, Ohio, Geneseo, N.Y., Niagra Falls, N.Y., Mendon, N.Y., Aurelius, N.Y., Spencerport, N.Y., Port Byron, N.Y., Palmyra. Hill Cumorah and Sacred Grove at Manchester, Fayette, N.Y. (all of these [marked locations] can be reached in one days driving from Rochester). Lansingburgh, N.Y., Waterford, N.Y., Pittsfield and Hinsdale, Mass., Benson and Danby, Vt., Boston, Mass., Kingston or Point Judith R.I., Old Lyme, Westport, Hartford, Conn., New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., etc. I could leave St Louis say on a Thursday evening, having worked the early tour on a trade that day. I could be in Denver the following P.M. and would leave Denver that same P.M. at 4:00 and arrive at Burlington the next morning which would be Saturday. Previously having gotten in touch with some LDS brother by mail who resides in Burlington, and have him engaged to spend three or four hours driving me down to Nauvoo and Carthage and back to Burlington that P.M. at 5:00 when I would depart arriving in Chicago at 8:45 P.M. I would spend Sunday in Chicago would attend LDS services somewhere, then take a sight seeing trip, visit Grant Park and late that P.M. run up to Milwaukee and back. Monday when my vacation began I would be in Detroit and in Buffalo that same night. I attended all my meetings today.\n",
      "\n",
      "1948-08-26:  Autumn is in the air. Soon cold weather will be with us again, but I don't dislike the winters like I used to. With the listing of this property and its possible sale and the hurried quest for a trade in California thereafter, I shall be forced to postpone my vacation and any eastern tour until next May or until the home is sold. If and when we sell, we will buy a car and take this long-delayed trip east. If I were to drive east, I would go up through Yellowstone Park, then east through the Dakotas, into Minnesota and Wisconsin, then south to Nauvoo and Carthage.\n",
      "\n",
      "1948-08-19:  The CB & Q office called me today to inform me they had heard from their agent at Keokuk. He has made arrangements with a friend auto dealer in the town, for me to drive a car over to Nauvoo and Carthage. The cost will be only $300 plus the gas. The train fare from Burlington to Keokuk and return shouldn't be more than $3.\n",
      "\n",
      "1948-02-28:  I picked up a U.P. timetable today, thinking perhaps I would go east via the U.P. but since it misses Nauvoo farther than the CB&Q I'll take the Rio Grande and CB&Q into Chicago; from there I want to take the NY Central to N.Y. via Boston and the Pennsylvania from N.Y.C. to Washington D.C.I work today, will have Tuesday off as a comp day. It happens thus each 9th Saturday. I mean that each night Saturday I get a Tuesday coffee. The other two Saturdays I work I get Fridays as comp days. I am delighted with the amount of new family groups the new objective is adding to my genealogical record. I am sure that when the shuts are cleared I'll find that nearly all temple work will already have been done. I computed my outgo on debts today and I find that for at least 6 months to come I will have to pay out $80 per month. This includes $32.50 per month on borrowed money; $15 per month on merchandise and the balance is tithing.   The Prophet Joseph, prophesying in a letter which he wrote to a Mr Seaton, a publisher, that \"not many years shall pass away before the United States shall present such a scene of bloodshed as has not a parallel in the history of our nation; pestilence, hail, famine and earthquake will sweep the wicked of this generation from off the face of the land etc. D.H.C.

      "1948-06-06:  At 2:30 this morning an officer at police headquarters called us on the phone and informed us that they had our boy, Harry, in the city jail charged with car prowling. He, Sonny came home this p.m., said that due to a lack of evidence they released the three of them; Dennis and Bill Worthen and Harry. He has stuck very close today. Maybe they put a scare into him.\\n\\tCathy and I went up to Hogle Gardens today and while there we saw the great Pioneer Monument for the first time. It is a magnificent monument. The three central figures, representing Brigham Young, Heber C Kimball and Wilford Woodruff, stand 40 ft above the walk. Western historic characters such as Peter Shane Ogden, chief Washakie, Captain Fremont, Father De Smet and Captain Bonneville appear in bronze relief on the east side.\\n\\tThe monument I observed does not stand true to the poles, to me it appeared to face a West, North Westerly Direction (towards the temple).\n",

      "1948-01-25:  We had a most bitter quarrel, Grace and I, last night. I packed some stuff in two bags and left. I had only 10 cents in cash so couldn't get a room. I left the bags at the archive and thought I would sleep there on a cot in the lady's lounge but a janitor worked there cleaning nearly all night so I sat up in the lobby of the Hotel Utah, went over to the archive at 7:00 a.m. and laid down and slept until 10:00. At 2:00, being starved I went down to the PO and had a sandwich, some cookies, a roll and a bottle of pop. This evening, being again at the archive I walked down to the 17th Ward to Sacrament meeting, saw a few of the old timers. After 13 years the faces change. Immediately associated the interior of the beautiful old place with my beloved friend, Bishop Nicholas G. Smith. I could see him in my mind's eye sitting on the rostrum , standing at the pulpit, going up the steps with that sort of hop or skip which characterized any quick or hurried move he made. I cannot put into words the feelings that seeing the old chapel, which holds so many treasured memories, brought afresh from my memory. It was there that I first stood on my feet and with fear and fathering bore my testimony for the first time. Brother Hiram M. Jaglar, a patriarch now deceased, sat beside me and encouraged me to arise. I attended my meetings regularly there for some seven years. They were the happiest years of my life. I have never seemed to fit into any ward like I did the old 17th, that, I am sure, is because I haven't been as faithful in paying my tides and offerings as I then was. Oh that I could, Heavenly Father, be as good a Latter-Day Saint again as I then was or even better. With memories so refreshed I banished, or tried to banish, the ill feeling I had for Grace and in spite of the fact that she refused to talk to me when I called home on the phone, I came back like a licked pup, like a little boy would do when he got hungry. Tonight, here in my comfortable home I want to express in a few simple words how grateful I am to my Heavenly Father for his abundant blessings during the past 20 years, or nearly so. During those early years he gave me richly of his spirit, the spirit of repentance, the spirit of fellowship with my fellow man. He gave me the holy priesthood which I have endeavored to carry with dignity and honor and all in all so enriched my poor life that I became vibrant, alive and happy. As I reflect upon those happy days I realize the inroads Satan has made toward my spiritual destruction, which brings me to say: God help me to overcome the evil one, that his purposes to destroy me shall fail and that I come off in the end the victor. Please, Heavenly Father, bless me that I overcome this terrible temper I have developed. Please also bless me that somehow, with thy help, I can reestablish family prayers in my home. That I learn patience, tolerance, kindness, forbearance and charity: I ask in Jesus' name: Amen. A fierce, cold winter blast is blowing tonight. Makes one thankful to have a warm, cozy home.\n",

      "1948-01-28:  We should have been paid yesterday according to the schedule of the past, but Will Holmes, secretary to Bishop Meyers has been sick hence our pay has been delayed. We hope we get it tomorrow. Last Sunday evening I was at the archive just prior to returning home. While I was there the night man came into the building to ring his hourly clock and he saw me. There was quite a to do about it today. I don't know why he waited until today, the final analysis was I and he met with Bishop Isaacson of the Presiding Bishopric where the affair was all straightened out. Bro Robbins, the night watchman was badly embarrassed and was as red as a beat when Bishop Isaacson related in our hearing the story Bro Robbins head previously told Bishop Isaacson about running into a mean, vicious, burglar Sunday evening. I agreed to turn in my key - not that I was asked to - but I made the offer as a gesture of Faith to assure Bishop Isaacson that such an incident would not happen again. I could understand Bishop Isaacson's concern about the incident when I learned from him that only the night before someone broke into a safe in the genealogical building or the adjoining building and stole $280. When I go east this summer or fall I aim to take a side trip south from Washington DC down through Virginia, through Richmond and Norfolk to Elizabeth City North Carolina. When I reach St Louis on my return trip I aim to take a side trip down the Mississippi probably by train or bus to New Orleans. From there I aim to go eastward through Mobile, Alabama to Pensacola, Florida. I'd like to go south from St Louis on one side of the Mississippi and return to St Louis on the other. From the eastern bank of the Mississippi it is only a short jump maybe 100 miles over to the Texas border. If I can make these proposed side trips I will then have been in all the states of the Union except North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, South Carolina and Georgia. As I once stated one of my ambitions is to go into each of the 48 states.\n",

      "1948-02-01:  It is a bright, beautiful spring-like day; warm and delightful. Charles and I attended our quorum meeting this morning, later Sunday School and later fast and testimony meeting. I've been thinking just since I started to write that we misspell and misuse the word \"bear\" with respect to testimonies. I am sure that it should be \"bare\" - to lay bare - to exhibit - to open to view. And never should we say \"he bore his testimony\" because \"bore\" is the past tense of \"bear\" while bared is the past tense of \"bare\". We should say \"he bared his testimony\". I am disappointed with Bro. Clegg, the newly appointed gospel Doctrine Sunday school class instructor. Today more than ever he let the class get out of hand, discussing pro and con subject matter apart from the outline, to no one's improvement. One particular point he raised today and said that the historical record would prove that the Prophet used a seer stone in conjunction with the Urim and Thummim. This I had never heard before and I doubt its truth. If the prophet found and used a seer stone to translate The Book of Mormon, what was wrong with the Urim and Thummim?\n",

      "1948-09-01:  Referring to last night's entry, I should also say I am not in favor of leaving Salt Lake. As I have often said on these pages, I would make my home in the east somewhere if my home life had become unbearable. Please, Heavenly Father, open the way so that I can still take my proposed eastern Genealogical Vacation, sightseeing tour of the east, the northeast, the southeast, and the south. From Sam Brook's wife I learned this evening that they still don't know what his ailment is. The doctor did say, however, that it was not phlebitis. He is in constant pain, except when he is full of opiates.\n",

      "1948-02-09:  Last night I wrote 11 letters to as many postmasters in Buffalo, Albany, Rochester, Syracuse, Troy, Pittsfield, New London, Bridgeport, New Haven, Hartford and Providence. From at least one I should receive a favorable reply.    It is my plan to take Charles and Cathy east with me also my sister Rowennah as a housekeeper if Grace and I don't get along any better together during the ensuing 8 months than we have this past year. By that time I think I could be out of debt and free, so far as any creditors are concerned, to leave the state. During that period we could also sell our home. I would give Grace the proceeds from the sale to buy herself a home or whatever else she wished to buy with the $3,000. That would be a cash settlement. I could go back to living like a normal man; working 8 hours per day, getting some recreation each day and get 8 hours sleep out of 24. We would need a foot locker and two bags for our clothes. My books could be shipped ahead by parcel post. In whatever town we found ourselves we would find a branch of the Church and plenty of Church work to keep Charles and I busy. We would have family prayer at least once each day and the children would be taught to pray and keep the Commandments of the Lord. I could continue with my genealogical research work and Temple work just as though I lived in Salt Lake City. It is snowing this evening.\n",

      "1948-03-01:  March came in like a lamb. The weather was beautiful this morning; it is rather cold tonight.    Resuming my proposed trip schedule. By arriving in Chicago Saturday evening I could get a good night's rest, rise early and go up to Milwaukee for Sunday school, getting back to Chicago about 2:00 p.m., take a sight seeing tour, go to Sacrament meeting and later run out and visit with Katharina. Monday morning I would leave for Detroit, spend only a few hours there and be on my way again, arriving in Cleveland early enough to get a car and get out to Willoughby - or Kirtland. Spend Monday night in Cleveland, or if a later train could get me into Buffalo by 10:00 p.m. I'd go on thru. I would spend Tuesday in Buffalo going to city cemetery, visiting the Buffalo Savings Bank, looking around, see what is located at 611 Main St where Gt Grandfather used to live. Take a sightseeing ride and in the late afternoon go up to Niagara Falls. I would leave Buffalo Wednesday morning arriving at Rochester about 2 hours later. I'd spend Wednesday driving here and there about the surrounding countries, visiting the places I propose to see. Probably leave Rochester that evening and arrive at Albany at night late. I would spend Thursday visiting Troy, Lansingburgh, Waterford Cemetery and later catch a bus for Rutland, Vermont or rent a car and drive to Benson and Danby and return. I would like, however to spend a day in Benson visiting if I had the time to spare. Saturday I would spend in Pittsfield and Hinsdale. In Lansingburgh I would try to visit my great great grandfather Henry's grave, in Waterford I would try to visit my great-great-grandmother Henry's grave and the grave of her sister Mary Clift. In Hinsdale I would try to visit my great-great-grandfather Howard's grave. Sunday I would be in Boston in time to attend Sacrament meeting and maybe take a sightseeing ride. Sunday evening I would go up to Portland Maine and back the following day. One week of my three weeks vacation will be gone.\n",

      "1948-09-19:  Cathy and I went to the fair this day. Saw the exhibits, which I thought were quite interesting. They were interesting to stock raisers, farmers, poultry men, etc. What I had hoped to see was scientific and industrial developments. Went down to meet Will Holmes this morning for a vocal lesson but missed him, so I spent about 2 hours on my personal genealogical records. I have 486 completed family groups with all ordinances completed. I have only scratched the vast surface of vicarious work.\\n\\tThe vacation I had scheduled for next month, I am postponing until May. Of course, if our home sells in the meantime and I move to Rochester, I'll take the vacation after I leave here and before I start there.\n",

      "1948-04-07:  The theme of last night was closed incomplete because I couldn't find my Doctrine and Covenants, from which I was going to quote.\\n\\tArdis' port call came a few days ago. She has to be in San Francisco on the 21st. Her boat sales on the 24th, that's 2 weeks from next Saturday. It is going to be darn lonesome here when Ardie and her two babies leave.\\n\\tThe 118th General Conference came to a close yesterday. I did not attend any of the sessions though I did listen to lots of it on the radio. The most valuable council to me came from president Clark about putting our homes in order, which the Lord helping me, I aim to attempt to do. I want to get the sermons of this conference as soon as they are compiled and printed.\\n\\tMaybe we will have a new roof on our house in the near future. A man was here this morning, gave us an estimate and said they would begin in a few days. It will cost us $307 payable $10 per month, beginning in June. It would take two and a half to three years to pay it off.\n",

      "1948-04-06:  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized by Divine command 118 years ago today at the home of Peter Whitmer in Fayette, Seneca County New York, with six members who had previously been baptized.\\n\\tThe Prophet Joseph Smith, whom the Lord had chosen for this great important responsibility; of re-establishing the Church of Jesus Christ upon the Earth; was at that time in his 25th year. He had been tutored by the almighty for the space of 10 years, and seen God, the Eternal Father and his son Jesus Christ when they personally appeared to him in the sacred grove during the early days of the spring of 1820. 3 Years later a Heavenly messenger who introduced himself as Moroni, an angel sent from the presence of God, visited the lad in his bedroom when his parents resided on a farm near Manchester, New York. 4 years from that day he received from the Angel Moroni the gold plates which the same angel had deposited and hidden away 1,400 years earlier, or about 400 AD. The plates were translated by him through the gift and power of God and aid of the Urim and Thummim.\\n\\tA member of divine revelations had been given the young prophet prior to the date mentioned in the opening of tonight's treatise. From one of the later sections of the book called \"the Doctrine and Covenants\" I shall quote a few lines to show how closely this young man lived to his God and how his Lord spoke to him either by his voice or by inspiration and revelation, during many years.\n",

      "1948-11-14:  Cathy and I went to Sacrament Meeting this evening. It was ward conference. I was grateful for the privilege of being present and partaking of the sacrament, and the fine spirit present. One of the speakers was Bro. Sharon T. Tanner, an old friend from the 13th Ward days; he was then in the bishopric of that ward when we met in the 20th Ward chapel.\n",

      "1948-07-04:  Mother arrived in Salt Lake Friday evening. I met her at the Depot and sent her on home in a cab as I had to work. We had received a wire from Lora and on Wednesday announcing mother's arrival time. She looks well doesn't seem at all her age. She is going down to Richfield to spend her vacation while Art is having his. They are going up to Nampa thence to San Jose to take Mom back home. They are going to see if they can do something for Rowennah.\n",

      "1948-02-13:  Ann Durham, wife of Bro. Alfred M. Durham, died Wednesday evening. Her funeral will be conducted tomorrow at Jos. William Taylor Mortuary. Ann  died from cancer. Brother Durham has buried two wives, his first, the mother of his children, died in 1931. He was then a councillor to Bishop Nicholas G. Smith of the 17th Ward. It looks like Ardie is going to Okinawa to join Frank. How soon she will be leaving I don't know, maybe within 30 days. When I go east this fall I am planning to take a side trip from Washington D.C. to Savannah, Ga. one way by water the other by rail or bus. With all the side trips I have planned for that trip I'll sure be busy. The first one along the way will be from Burlington, Ia to Carthage, Il via Nauvoo. The second will be from Chicago to Kenosha, Wis. just to add Wisconsin to my string of states. The next will be from Buffalo to Niagara Falls and another from Buffalo to Geneseo, N.Y. The next will be from Albany, N.Y. to Rutland, VT. The next from Boston to Berwick, ME. The next will be from Washington D.C. to Savannah, Ga. The next will be from St Louis to New Orleans and from New Orleans to Pensacola, Fla. This trip is with the proposed side trips will carry me into Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, Arkansas. If I have the money and time when I get back to Denver I shall take a trip South through New Mexico, Oklahoma and into Texas. If I can do this I will have been in every state in the Union except North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. A trip into the Northwest this summer will add Oregon and Washington to the list.\n",
