Two things I prayed I might succeed at; i.e. pay an honest tithe and magnify whatever job I might be asked to do by those in authority in the ward or state. I have been thinking about changing PO duty tour to day hours; 6:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. This would change my archive hours till say 3:30 till 9:30 p.m. but it would allow me at least one evening each week to devote to some sort of church service. I am dying spiritually mostly from a lack of activity."

Well he passed out, momentarily and I thought he was either going to have a fit or go into a convulsion, but it passed quickly and he was normal again. He returns in the morning to Philadelphia where he is photographing old vital records. He works like a horse, only longer hours than a horse could take. I told him that if he didn't slow up, work normal 8-hour day and get some relaxation and recreation they would ship him home in a box, but I doubt if what I told him will receive any consideration and I'll wager he won't last very long if he doesn't heed my advice and the advice of his employers, the Genealogical Society. Having worked 5 hours on New Year's Day I took that amount of time off today; just window shopped, went to a show and took it easy. My left upper arm and shoulder have been aching some of late. I am sure it's on account of one or two bad teeth. Little Barbara hasn't been very well these past two or three days; seems to have canker or is cutting some double teeth. She has a sore mouth, cries a lot at night.I am attaching a clipping which is self-explanatory and shows the degree of inflated food prices, other commodity prices are as high or higher as well as rent and property values."

I have gone entirely through my record, and save for a very few group sheets now ready for cleaning, I am all cleaned up. My next objective is to begin doing some earnest research on the Henry, Howard, Colt, Butler or other line or lines now. My Heavenly father has blessed me marvelously in the past years, placing in my hands as it were, the records of thousands of my forebears. I am sure that as there are yet unnumbered thousands whose records are unknown at this time, he will also Place many of their records into my hands if I continue humble and prayerful and diligently seek for those records. I am particularly anxious to find some clue that will lead to the records of the ancestors of Dr Michael Henry of Lansingburgh, New York, one of my second great grandfathers. At present my knowledge of him is very limited. He was a resident of Lansingburgh when he married Abigail Haggard 10 July 1788 at Fairfield, Connecticut. He died at Lansingburgh 1811. He had served as a surgeon in the revolution and was a leading Presbyterian in a Rensselaer County."

        "text": "It was 18 years ago today that my father died at the family residence in Rexburg, Idaho, following a serious illness of only a day's duration. He had had a bad heart condition for near 10 years but it was not that so serious.     My father was a pioneer of the Upper Snake River Valley. I don't know the time of his arrival there, but it was, I presume soon after his uncle Dick Jardine went there which was 1881 or 1882. Father went up there in 1884 or 1885 when a boy of about 14 years. He had been an orphan since 1881 when his mother died. His father, who he did not remember, died in early 1873. He had poor rearing - in fact so far as I can learn he had no rearing from his mother. He spent most of his pre-marital years from before the death of his mother, with his grandmother Ellsworth. During his early manhood years both before and after his marriage he was employed a lot by his Uncle Ed Ellsworth, a none-too-honest a man, who used to take advantage of his timid, afraid to stand up for his own rights, easily led nephew. Father has said that always his dealings with his uncle left him in the little end of the horn. My father had a hard life. As I have said many times, if he was on a truck digging job he was in the bottom where the mud was the deepest, where the work was the hardest and where it was the hottest. How oft I have wished he could have worked with me where the work is easy and agreeable and interesting."

        "text": "We had a most bitter quarrel, Grace and I, last night. I packed some stuff in two bags and left. I had only 10 cents in cash so couldn't get a room. I left the bags at the archive and thought I would sleep there on a cot in the lady's lounge but a janitor worked there cleaning nearly all night so I sat up in the lobby of the Hotel Utah, went over to the archive at 7:00 a.m. and laid down and slept until 10:00. At 2:00, being starved I went down to the PO and had a sandwich, some cookies, a roll and a bottle of pop. This evening, being again at the archive I walked down to the 17th Ward to Sacrament meeting, saw a few of the old timers. After 13 years the faces change. Immediately associated the interior of the beautiful old place with my beloved friend, Bishop Nicholas G. Smith. I could see him in my mind's eye sitting on the rostrum , standing at the pulpit, going up the steps with that sort of hop or skip which characterized any quick or hurried move he made. I cannot put into words the feelings that seeing the old chapel, which holds so many treasured memories, brought afresh from my memory. It was there that I first stood on my feet and with fear and fathering bore my testimony for the first time. Brother Hiram M. Jaglar, a patriarch now deceased, sat beside me and encouraged me to arise. I attended my meetings regularly there for some seven years. They were the happiest years of my life. I have never seemed to fit into any ward like I did the old 17th, that, I am sure, is because I haven't been as faithful in paying my tides and offerings as I then was. Oh that I could, Heavenly Father, be as good a Latter-Day Saint again as I then was or even better. With memories so refreshed I banished, or tried to banish, the ill feeling I had for Grace and in spite of the fact that she refused to talk to me when I called home on the phone, I came back like a licked pup, like a little boy would do when he got hungry. Tonight, here in my comfortable home I want to express in a few simple words how grateful I am to my Heavenly Father for his abundant blessings during the past 20 years, or nearly so. During those early years he gave me richly of his spirit, the spirit of repentance, the spirit of fellowship with my fellow man. He gave me the holy priesthood which I have endeavored to carry with dignity and honor and all in all so enriched my poor life that I became vibrant, alive and happy. As I reflect upon those happy days I realize the inroads Satan has made toward my spiritual destruction, which brings me to say: God help me to overcome the evil one, that his purposes to destroy me shall fail and that I come off in the end the victor. Please, Heavenly Father, bless me that I overcome this terrible temper I have developed. Please also bless me that somehow, with thy help, I can reestablish family prayers in my home. That I learn patience, tolerance, kindness, forbearance and charity: I ask in Jesus' name: Amen. A fierce, cold winter blast is blowing tonight. Makes one thankful to have a warm, cozy home."

There are thousands of families of Europeans who do not have fuel nor enough clothing nor bedding to keep them warm.

Mama hasn't spoken to me since I returned home. I can't blame her. When I think about our terrible scene I am mortified with shame. I would like to tell her how ashamed I am of myself, but probably to say anything would be worse than saying nothing. I hope and pray that my heavenly father will help me to overcome my bad temper. I got angry far too easy. I would like to be like the biblical statement which says \"he who control with his spirit is greater than he who takes a city.\""

We hope we get it tomorrow. Last Sunday evening I was at the archive just prior to returning home. While I was there the night man came into the building to ring his hourly clock and he saw me. There was quite a to do about it today. I don't know why he waited until today, the final analysis was I and he met with Bishop Isaacson of the Presiding Bishopric where the affair was all straightened out. Bro Robbins, the night watchman was badly embarrassed and was as red as a beat when Bishop Isaacson related in our hearing the story Bro Robbins head previously told Bishop Isaacson about running into a mean, vicious, burglar Sunday evening. I agreed to turn in my key - not that I was asked to - but I made the offer as a gesture of Faith to assure Bishop Isaacson that such an incident would not happen again. I could understand Bishop Isaacson's concern about the incident when I learned from him that only the night before someone broke into a safe in the genealogical building or the adjoining building and stole $280. When I go east this summer or fall I aim to take a side trip south from Washington DC down through Virginia, through Richmond and Norfolk to Elizabeth City North Carolina. When I reach St Louis on my return trip I aim to take a side trip down the Mississippi probably by train or bus to New Orleans. From there I aim to go eastward through Mobile, Alabama to Pensacola, Florida. I'd like to go south from St Louis on one side of the Mississippi and return to St Louis on the other. From the eastern bank of the Mississippi it is only a short jump maybe 100 miles over to the Texas border. If I can make these proposed side trips I will then have been in all the states of the Union except North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, South Carolina and Georgia. As I once stated one of my ambitions is to go into each of the 48 states."

I've been thinking just since I started to write that we misspell and misuse the word \"bear\" with respect to testimonies. I am sure that it should be \"bare\" - to lay bare - to exhibit - to open to view. And never should we say \"he bore his testimony\" because \"bore\" is the past tense of \"bear\" while bared is the past tense of \"bare\". We should say \"he bared his testimony\". I am disappointed with Bro. Clegg, the newly appointed gospel Doctrine Sunday school class instructor. Today more than ever he let the class get out of hand, discussing pro and con subject matter apart from the outline, to no one's improvement. One particular point he raised today and said that the historical record would prove that the Prophet used a seer stone in conjunction with the Urim and Thummim. This I had never heard before and I doubt its truth. If the prophet found and used a seer stone to translate The Book of Mormon, what was wrong with the Urim and Thummim?"

I would give Grace the proceeds from the sale to buy herself a home or whatever else she wished to buy with the $3,000. That would be a cash settlement. I could go back to living like a normal man; working 8 hours per day, getting some recreation each day and get 8 hours sleep out of 24. We would need a foot locker and two bags for our clothes. My books could be shipped ahead by parcel post. In whatever town we found ourselves we would find a branch of the Church and plenty of Church work to keep Charles and I busy. We would have family prayer at least once each day and the children would be taught to pray and keep the Commandments of the Lord.

I did some research today on the James Harmison line.  He married two of the daughters of Gideon and Betsy Brownell. Fanny Elizabeth married first a William Steele in the endowment house - rather they were sealed in the endowment house having been previously married (I presume). Then in May 1870, 4 years after she had been sealed to Steele, she was sealed to James Harmison who had married her sister Mary Ann Experience. So to me it appears that she had divorced William Steele and had the sealing cancelled. One other daughter Hannah married William Vaughan. It appears that Vaughan and his wife did not join the Church and hence did not come west. There is no record of either of them in the Index Bureau nor in early Utah history. Another daughter presumably married Jesse Pierson, I can learn nothing about him either, and I don't know the name of his wife. Gathering this information is part of the project I am working on at present, of delving into heretofore uncompleted families of my direct ancestors. The present family is that of Gideon Brownell. With the work of \"gathering out\" these uncles and their wives and families and the aunts with their husbands and children, I am also to gather information necessary to complete the biographical sketches I have long since started, and so badly neglected. The Eastern tour, scheduled for early October will cost $115 for St Louis to Boston round trip and $100 for side trips and $100 for expenses. That's for one. If Grace goes it will cost nearly twice that."

He has drunk enough liquor in the past 25 years to have bought and paid for a fine home, to say nothing of the damage it is done to him; spiritually and physically. I must write a short letter to Mother. I get angry when I think about the damnable, shabby way Rowenna has been treated during the past 20 years, just like she was poison or contaminated. I often think about an Old Testament prophecy which runs something like this: \"A mother might forsake her own, but I will never forsake thee, O House of Israel.\" It is a very serious offense to desert or forsake a child, throwing it upon the mercy of the state because of a mental or physical defect unless it should be mentally insane, I mean an insane criminal, one whose conduct could not be trusted, I think such people should, in fairness to themselves and their families, be placed in an institution, but to place a sweet, inoffensive little girl in such a place away from those who should give her the kindest care; is in my humble opinion, a criminal act and someday will have to be answered for before the judgment bar of the Great Judge. And it will not be easy. If my Heavenly Father will open my way before me I will take my sister out of that den and place her where she can live like a normal human being. I am worried about her. I haven't heard from her in weeks. I'm ashamed to say it, but the last few letters she wrote I did not read. They were destroyed, and now I don't know what she may have told me. Had I read them maybe the silence would have been explained. Her letters are childish and infantile which probably explains why I let them lay without reading them. About two weeks ago I sent her some writing paper and a supply of stamped envelopes. She, unlike her, has not acknowledged the little present. Later I wrote her a letter, telling her I was worried at her long silence. From that letter I have received no reply, which is very disturbing to me. I wonder if she is ill. I wonder if she is injured, or is it possible that she is no longer at the institution. I plan to go up to Nampa the end of next month and see Rowennah and learn by talking with her and by consulting with the authorities there if she is capable of keeping house and cooking."

There is something mysterious and sinister about his death. I think, as did his parents, that there was foul play. Another reply was received today. It came from Patrick J Goode; postmaster at New Haven, Connecticut. He says he is posting my letter as that anyone desiring to trade to SLC can communicate with me direct. Probably my next move is to have an insertion put in the Union Postal Clerk - our national organization's magazine, telling where I want to trade to."

Tomorrow I'll trouble them again (I didn't have time to wait today) and get the cost of a round trip bus fare from St Louis to New Orleans. It will be a little less than $17 I believe. The bus fare from New Orleans over to Pensacola shouldn't be more than $5. From Chicago to Milwaukee and return will be say $5; from Albany to Rutland and return $3; from Boston to Portland and return about $5; from Washington DC to Savannah and return $17; from St Louis to New Orleans and return $15 and from New Orleans to Pensacola and return $5 a total of $48 plus the fare from Denver to Dalhart Texas and return.

We are praying for her; that she shall be given strength to undergo the operation, that the operation will be successful in that in a short time she can return to her work. This morning before leaving for work I cleaned out the plugged goose neck in the basin and this evening I put a new washer on the hot water tap in the kitchen sink. Leree Baker, a friend since about 1936 and a widow since 1935, an employee of the temple with whom I work each morning, is being married this week. There is rumor at the Archive that we are going to have a new supervisor. I'll guess it will be Harold Jacobsen, an old time employee of the society who has just been discharged from the Army. I was thinking today as I was looking at a map of the US that I could go to Winona, Minnesota from Chicago thence to Milwaukee and back to Chicago for about $3 more than a round trip from Chicago to Milwaukee. If I did that and in addition took the side trip from Denver down to Dalhart and back and supposing I go up to Seattle this summer I should then have been in all of the states of the Union except North and South Dakota."

I started up to the Vets hospital this evening but I found when I got into town that I couldn't make it by 8:15 (visitors are admitted from 7:15 till 8:15 P.M.). I inquired at the St Louis bus depot for round trip fare from St Louis to New Orleans. The fare is $21.85. Now $17 + $22 + $5 (Chicago to Milwaukee and return) plus $6 (Boston to Portland in return) plus the cost of a rented car to drive from Keokuk, Ia to Nauvoo and Carthage and return, which shouldn't be more than $10 plus about $4 from Albany to Rutland, Vt and return. All together total $64. My railroad fare will cost me $115, side trips (all by bus) $65 plus $100 for expenses totals $280. An extra $20 for incidentals makes $300. Considering that with or for that amount I can tour the US with the exception of Oregon, Washington, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. As I have said before; if, when I get into Pueblo, Colo on my return trip, I have enough dough left I aim to take a side trip to Dalhart, Tex. which will take me through New Mex., Okla. and into Tex. I will then have been in 43 of the 48 states. Summer trip up to Seattle will make the total 45.   If only my Heavenly Father will let me make this trip. I should say these trips. I'm going to pray about it repeatedly until my Father in Heaven either gives me the assurance that it is all right or takes from me this indescribable obsession.   I want, oh so bad, to see Nauvoo, Carthage, my Great Grandfather's picture which hangs either in Lansing or Detroit, Mich (maybe both) Kirtland, Ohio, Geneseo, N.Y., Niagra Falls, N.Y., Mendon, N.Y., Aurelius, N.Y., Spencerport, N.Y., Port Byron, N.Y., Palmyra.

I could be in Denver the following P.M. and would leave Denver that same P.M. at 4:00 and arrive at Burlington the next morning which would be Saturday. Previously having gotten in touch with some LDS brother by mail who resides in Burlington, and have him engaged to spend three or four hours driving me down to Nauvoo and Carthage and back to Burlington that P.M. at 5:00 when I would depart arriving in Chicago at 8:45 P.M. I would spend Sunday in Chicago would attend LDS services somewhere, then take a sight seeing trip, visit Grant Park and late that P.M. run up to Milwaukee and back. Monday when my vacation began I would be in Detroit and in Buffalo that same night. I attended all my meetings today."

Monday morning I would leave for Detroit, spend only a few hours there and be on my way again, arriving in Cleveland early enough to get a car and get out to Willoughby - or Kirtland. Spend Monday night in Cleveland, or if a later train could get me into Buffalo by 10:00 p.m. I'd go on thru. I would spend Tuesday in Buffalo going to city cemetery, visiting the Buffalo Savings Bank, looking around, see what is located at 611 Main St where Gt Grandfather used to live. Take a sightseeing ride and in the late afternoon go up to Niagara Falls. I would leave Buffalo Wednesday morning arriving at Rochester about 2 hours later. I'd spend Wednesday driving here and there about the surrounding countries, visiting the places I propose to see. Probably leave Rochester that evening and arrive at Albany at night late. I would spend Thursday visiting Troy, Lansingburgh, Waterford Cemetery and later catch a bus for Rutland, Vermont or rent a car and drive to Benson and Danby and return. I would like, however to spend a day in Benson visiting if I had the time to spare. Saturday I would spend in Pittsfield and Hinsdale. In Lansingburgh I would try to visit my great great grandfather Henry's grave, in Waterford I would try to visit my great-great-grandmother Henry's grave and the grave of her sister Mary Clift. In Hinsdale I would try to visit my great-great-grandfather Howard's grave. Sunday I would be in Boston in time to attend Sacrament meeting and maybe take a sightseeing ride.

I know I was inspired to get into this neglected field of my genealogical responsibility. Hundreds whose records have never been brought to light and whose temple work they have long awaited will be accomplished thanks be to my Heavenly Father. It is an engrossing and stimulating work. It is the Lord's work, and whatever degree of success I realize from month to month, my Heavenly Father receives the honor and the praise and thanks, for it is his God-given spirit that prompts my efforts and his spirit that guides my search to the sought-after records, it was his spirit that moved upon men in past ages to make records of birth, marriages and deaths, and it was his spirit that prompted men and women to publish to the world the records made hundreds of years earlier. So what things are due me? None. All that I have found, all that I have recorded, all that I have presented in the Lord's House for saving ordinances has been done because my Heavenly Father blessed me with the spirit of Elijah (if I understand aright). Today, and for several days, at scattered opportunities of a few moments at a time, I have been gathering information for record of the Aldens of early American antiquity. It happens to be Aldens because that family is about the first in my alphabetically arranged genealogical record. Today is the 185th anniversary of the birth in Hopkinton, Massachusetts of my 3rd Great Grandfather, John Young. He died at Quincy, Illinois in 1839. The saints, seeking a haven of rest and refuge from their Missouri persecutors, who had driven them at the point of guns from their homes, causing many to perish from exposure and mobbings, or camping some of them, temporarily, at Quincy. Father Young was old and could not bear such ruthless, inhuman, unchristian-like treatment; and sank down in death, but Father Young shall stand upon the Earth again in the flesh no more to be driven, mobbed and persecuted but shall dwell in Eternal Life with his Father and his God in pure felicity. May I too enjoy the greatest of blessings given of God to his obedient children; that of Eternal Life."

A letter in the clerk's box when I went to work today. Mr Warren E. Springer who resides at #40 5th Ave. Troy wants to get into a high locality on account of his wife's health. He is 41 years old, has one child, is a $3100 grade clerk. I shall write him a letter at once telling him the things he wishes to know about S.L.C.\\n\\tTroy, New York is quite ideal I think for me. It is close to nearly every point I want to visit, but most of all it is only an hour or so from Hartford. The Connecticut State Library is the place that interests me most. Troy is about 100 miles north of NYC on the Hudson River. It is about 5 miles from Albany the State capital. It is about 30 to 40 miles from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, about 40 miles from Hinsdale, Massachusetts, Waterford and Lansingburgh are very close. The former lies across the river in Saratoga County and Lansingburgh is a suburb of Troy, lying up the river three or four miles. It is only about 100 to 150 miles from Fairfield, Connecticut and about the same from New London and Lyme."

The plates were translated by him through the gift and power of God and aid of the Urim and Thummim.\\n\\tA member of divine revelations had been given the young prophet prior to the date mentioned in the opening of tonight's treatise.

What a great store Sears is since they moved into their newly built, huge, modern store, located at 754 South State. It reaches through the block from Main to State and about halfway to 7th south from 8th South with large parking space south of the store. Thousands of people were there shopping. We plan to buy our kitchen repair items there; like the new sink with fittings, wallpaper for two front rooms and our bedroom, paint for the kitchen and front rooms.\\n\\tWe have postponed remodeling the bathroom after a while. A built-in tub, a pedestal basin, tile to the wainscot, taking out the partition between the bath and toilet rooms and building a clothes closet along the west side of our bedroom would cost us, with the plumber's bill, about $350. I aim to do this job myself within the coming 2 years, for a lot less than $350."

        "text": "I went downtown early this morning to meet Will Holmes. He spent nearly 2 hours giving me a voice lesson. I am just beginning to show, finally, some signs of improvement.\\n\\tWhen we get our kitchen remodeled and painted; when we get the two front rooms papered and painted, Venetian blinds installed, new furniture and finally the bathroom modernized and beautified we will have a very beautiful home. But I am not sure that it will be any better place in which to live. Probably will not.\\n\\tThe payments on the home are $57 per month. The payments on the FHA loan for the new roof is $10 per month. The payment on the FHA loan for remodeling will be $23 per month. I am paying the credit union $12.50 per month, the American Investment Company $10 per month, the mutual loan company $5 per month making a total of $118 per month which I will pay from my Archive check and one P.O. check each month. In addition to this my tithing payments are $32 per month. A total of $140 out lay. In another city I would, of necessity have to get a part-time job for at least 3 years while I paid off my creditors. If I could earn $100 at part-time employment I could meet my SLC obligations each month and pay my way there OK. I think I could get a small two-room apartment for say $50 per month. My eats shouldn't cost more than $30 per month. My PO pay would be about $250 per month plus $100 for part-time employment making $350 per month. Of this amount $118 would have to be sent to Salt Lake to pay on debts and defray living expenses of my family. My own living expenses would be say $150 plus $35 tithing. Leaving me about $25 to spend or save.\\n\\tAt the end of 3 years, however, my debts would be reduced to $57 per month, the payment on this home. It will take eight more years to pay off this home.\\n\\tThe impossible conditions under this roof make it imperative that I sooner or later, make a change i.e. go away to some far distance city and state. After I got settled I would send Charles a bus ticket."

I have heard this man's name mentioned in my father's home several times, but today I know almost nothing about him. He was a native of South Africa, was born 1849 baptized 1857 and endowed 1870. What happened to him? where did he and his wife reside? Did they have children? These are some of the questions I hope to be able to answer if only I could learn the true parents of James Dennison Colt. I long since joined him to the family of Benjamin Colt of Lyme, but I have absolutely no evidence to substantiate this connection. I found no other family in Lyme who could have had a child born 1740, but that is not evidence, only guessing."

I remember, faintly, Aunt Allie Wilson and her daughter Dot Wilson. They lived in Lewisville many years ago. Aunt Allie is now dead and Dot must be a woman close to 60. She lives somewhere in California I think Alavon said.\\n\\tJames O Swift was a member of the church, was endowed 12th December 1870 in the endowment house and his wife was sealed to him that day by Elder Joseph T Smith, then an apostle.\\n\\tIt is so sweet of Alavon to call and see me each time she comes to town.

Windows and bookcases take the time.\\n\\tA most important question has been turning over and over in my mind of late. It is this: the vicarious work we do for the dead (and the temple ordinances the living perform for themselves) i.e. baptism, endowment and sealing of wives to husbands and children to parents, are ordinances which pertain to the Celestial Kingdom only; and since, so far as we are concerned, there is no Celestial Kingdom until after the resurrection and the final judgment hence these sacred ordinances are of no avail to anyone until after the resurrection when this Earth shall have passed through its paradisical glory and shall become a Celestial world for The Heirs of that Kingdom who had dwelled here in mortality.\\n\\tNow this is not, I am sure, generally accepted throughout the church, but nevertheless is fundamentally and logically true. No one I dare say who has died since the restoration of the Gospel in 1820 to 1830 has been raised from the dead.\\n\\tIt is true, let me add, that the spirits of those who have died prior to the Advent of the restored gospel, have heard it preached and taught and millions have accepted it and have repented and dwell in joy and happiness, looking forward, as do we in mortality, to that glorious day when our bodies shall be raised to incorruption and we may dwell in far greater and unbounded Joy than ever, and that our bodies are now Eternal and we having forsaken all of our evil doing are now capable and fit to dwell, as it were, in the presence of God; but there awaits the faithful of the Church of Christ as far, far, Greater Joy than dwelling in the presence of God - Which is far beyond our feeble ability to comprehend - that of becoming gods, of creating worlds and peopling them even as our heavenly father is doing with this Earth.\\n\\tAnd this is the purpose of the ordinances of the house of the Lord."

My heavenly father, to whom I had appealed for divine aid to modernize and beautify our home: and how marvelously he answered my prayers. I leave it to the reader to judge. First a fellow came in, got our signature and put a new composition roof on the house, which cost us $350 gross. Secondly; when we found that FHA money could be procured for improvements, we went down and borrowed $700 for remodeling and modernizing the home. Then thirdly we had to go back and borrow $150 additional to complete the latter job. So now we are back in debt, but so long as I can keep my part-time job it won't be hard on us.

So I am not alarmed.\\n\\tConsidering the amount of money I owe and the monthly payments I have to make on borrowed money, I am perplexed about my forthcoming proposed trip East. If I postpone it until next may it is highly probable that by that time there will be conditions that will prevent me from going; maybe it will be a lack of Finance (as it is the present problem), it might be transportation problems, it might be domestic trouble, it might be economic troubles. I feel that if I can't go this fall I won't go next spring. But to go this fall is nearly impossible. I have to pay the collector of internal revenue $70 July 28th and about $75 August 28th. These two payments will of course eat up my two archive checks for those months, leaving only my September check to put in the vacation pot. Say I could put $75 into the pot September 28th and I could get Grace to send me $50 from the October 4 check. If I could save $25 from August 1st check in $25 from September 1st check and put this $50 in the pot I would have $175. The balance I would have to borrow. $50 I could borrow from Gus Thurgood. Maybe I could get $100 from Wilby Johnson, two leading shysters at the PO. This program if I could follow it out would give me $325. The railroad fare will be $115; rented cars will cost about $25; side trips by bus will cost $65, a total of $205. The balance for hotel, eats, sightseeing and other incidental expenses.\\n\\tMy heavenly father: please, in as much as you have always come to my rescue when I need  aid; I humbly petitioned the, to grant me the privilege of taking this long-awaited, much desired vacation trip. I ask it in the name of my Lord and Redeemer, Jesus Christ; Amen.\\n\\tBy leaving the city Tuesday Eve September 28th I could be in Denver Wednesday p.m. And Burlington Thursday a.m. and Chicago Thursday evening. I could be in Detroit Friday p.m. and Cleveland Saturday and buffalo Saturday evening and Sunday Rochester Monday and Albany on Tuesday and one week of the 3 weeks are passed.\\n\\tIf I leave Tuesday p.m. September 28th and I don't return to work until Monday October 18th at 3:00 p.m. That's 3 weeks, but I'm only taking two weeks (10 days) of my 15 days vacation. only Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are charged to annual leave."

Then during the week following Charles gave us another present, one of usual kind we get from our children - in fact the only kind - he was picked up by the police together with some other hoodlums for stealing two cars. He is now at the boys home awaiting juvenile court hearing tomorrow. I am not going to lift a finger to get him or any of my other worthless, disrespectful, inconsiderate kids out of any jams they get themselves into, through disobedience.   Come the summer of 1951 when I hope to be out of debt, except this home. Then I am going away. I'm going to desert this ungrateful house full of vultures who want all and who give nothing but trouble. By then Cathy will be 8 and will not be the problem she would be at 5. In 3 years Sonny will be 19 in Charles will be 17, both should then be self-supporting because neither will be going to school. Neither of them wants an education. They don't and won't understand it's value until they are men and they have to eke out a living with their back muscles."

The genealogical society held its annual outing this evening at Lagoon and if Kathy had been well I would have taken her.    I wrote and posted a letter to Elder Joseph A McRae at Carthage Illinois who has charge of the old jail, which is an LDS Bureau of information. I asked his advice about how I could best reach Carthage and Nauvoo from Burlington or Keokuk Iowa. I also wrote the CB&Q passenger agent at Keokuk, asking him the same questions. Today I called at the office of the local CB&Q representative and asked him for the same information. He is going to write the passenger agents at Burlington and Keokuk. From one or more of these inquiries I should get the desired information.\\n\\tNext Tuesday morning I am going to take my driver's test at the state capital. A driver's license I must have, should I rent a car during my trip, which I will have to do in one or two places.\\n\\tThe railroad fare will cost me $10 more than I had anticipated. Instead of $115, it will be $125. The fare from Burlington to Keokuk and returning will be extra too; which will be about 3 to 4.\\n\\tOnly one thing can keep me from making this trip. Should the Spirit of the Lord caution me or object as it did upon once when I was about to enter a building, if that spirit says 'don't' then I won't, but otherwise, I am going to have to ride the rods and go ragged and hungry.\\n\\tMy proposed itinerary is as follows: Salt Lake City to Denver; Denver to Burlington, with a side trip to include Nauvoo and Carthage; from Burlington to Chicago. In Chicago, a side trip north to Milwaukee, WI. From Chicago to Detroit; from Detroit to Toledo and Cleveland, Ohio. Here a short side trip to Kirtland. From Cleveland to Buffalo with a side trip up to Niagara Falls. From Buffalo to Rochester. Here I rent a car and cover a number of nearby small towns; from Rochester to Palmyra with a short side trip to the Hill Cumorah and Sacred Grove. I am not opposed to selling this property. With the improvements we have made we should be able to get $13,000 without difficulty. The only drawbacks are a shallow basement and a converted furnace, and the back porch and garage. We owe about $3,800 on it plus $1,350 borrowed money. In addition, we owe about $250 in miscellaneous debts. Paying these off, buying a $1,500 used car would leave us about $8,000 clear to invest in a California home."

You need to come to Utah to make a home for her and you since Lora doesn't want her there. There is one thing more I want to tell Mother, and one thing more I want to tell Lora, and one of these days I'll get the two speeches out of my system. I want to tell Mother that the security she is getting from Lora will dwindle like a candle; it's that kind of security. She is buying it at the price of Rowenna's freedom. To Lora, I want to say, inasmuch as you have turned a cold, strange shoulder to the cries and pleading of an afflicted blood sister and have said in your heart, let her stay where she is, you too will one day be shunned by those to whom you are seeking sympathy. You will find yourself alone when you will need friendship, companionship, and help. I am going to call Bert tomorrow morning. Instead of waiting till tomorrow morning, I called him this evening and learned that his opinion of Rowenna's plight isn't as bad as I thought. He is going to write me a letter, telling me, as near as he can remember, the conversation he and my mother had with Dr. Allen at the school in Nampa. For Allen's reply to that letter I will forward to our Stake President. Bro. Elbert R. Curtis has been named by the First Presidency in charge of the new mission. Pres. Morris has been called to preside over the Eastern States Mission. Pres. Curtis' great-grandmother and my own great-grandmother were sisters and children of Pres. Brigham Young and his first wife Miriam Works. Elbert R. Curtis has brought honor, distinction, and glory to his lineage. I predict that Elbert R. Curtis will one day be named to a position among the General Authorities of the Church. God bless you, Bro. Curtis, in your new work.

Grant me a portion of thy divine power so that I shall walk in the path of rectitude and righteousness.

The Prudential Federal Corp. notified me today that they had approved my application to refinance the F.H.A. loans against our home. The combined F.H.A. & mortgage payments, he told me, would be $51.50 per month for 135 months; a little more than 11 years. This deal has been the subject of my prayers for many days. My Heavenly Father has again heard and answered my prayers, for which, Father, I am most grateful.\\n\\tSeveral days ago, I sent Bishop Rawson the $5.11 Charles had pilfered from fast offering envelopes.

        "text": "My two boys are worse than no sons. They are disobedient, disrespectful, and deceitful. They lie, steal, and cause continued trouble in the home. Neither of them came home last night and neither of them took the trouble to call home to tell us where they were. Harry was kicked out of school because he would do nothing in school, coming home with nothing on his report card but \"E\"s. Charles had to be transferred from the firing line of being kicked out of school. I haven't the remotest idea that he will do any better at Roosevelt either. It seems to me that these last three children, Sharon, Harry, and Charles, are social misfits. They don't seem to be able to adjust themselves to boys and girls their own ages. I'm thoroughly disgusted with the whole situation. I'd like to give Cathy an even break in life's struggle by taking her away from this hellish mess. If something isn't done, she will grow up to be as bad or worse than her brothers and her sister.\\n\\tMy home is an example of what happens to an LDS home where family prayer is not practiced, where the garment of the holy priesthood is cast off, where the mother and wife is without faith, who violates the Word of Wisdom, and who speaks slightingly of the leaders of the Church.\\n\\tThis is the kind of a home I want to take Cathy and myself out of, where I can find peace of mind and she can too. Maybe I have failed in my duties as a father, but let anyone who judges me as a failure try the same job with the opposition I have had. My wife has pulled against me all these many years. We have quarreled almost constantly, never seeing eye to eye on any subject of importance. I have tried to live my religion, tried to keep active in the Church, and have always been active in providing for my family.\\n\\tEarly in our married years, I tried to have family prayer, but my wife was not interested and never lent a cooperating spirit. I wanted us to work together in the Church, but she would not. The only time I recall her ever manifesting any interest was upon the occasion when Bishop Smith came to administer to her way back in 1928 when her life was in danger. When she had recovered, she forgot the promise she had made that we would get busy in the Church together.\\n\\tThe following year I took her to the temple and we were sealed for time and eternity by the authority of the holy priesthood. Almost from that day until four years ago when she finally took off her garment, she poked fun at it, cursed it and said I had taken her to the temple against her wish.\\n\\tIf one of our daughters had planned to marry a fine young man in the temple, I am sure she would have attempted to discourage the plan on account of the garment. Now she smokes, drinks, and since I first knew her, has been a coffee drinker. Of late years she profanes the name of Deity in the presence of her family. When she is angry she can out curse any prostitute or woman of the street.\\n\\tAll of our major troubles have come in these past four years since she has not worn the temple garment. First, she started stepping out on her husband, drinking, and then asked if she could take off the garment. Dorothy disliked it from the start, fought against it, and eventually would have taken it off with or without my consent anyway. Then Sharon got into trouble. Then, in desperation and after repeated threats, I also started stepping out. Well, we ironed these evils out and both devoted ourselves to each other. Then Sonny got into trouble when, according to his account, he stole three cars in rapid succession, then Charles was hauled into court for participating in the theft of two cars. Then the last blow was struck when Sharon confessed she was in trouble again.\\n\\tNow, I ask, what would the censurer of my acts do if he or she were in my shoes? While Harry was on the board of the Juvenile Court on probation, he participated in the theft of a truck last March, for which he has not yet stood trial, but soon must."

The new mortgage is now $5,150. This will be paid off at $51.50 per month for 135 months, plus $8.55 taxes, plus $0.95 fire insurance, making a total payment of $61 per month.\\n\\tThis much desired deal being closed is a direct answer to my prayers.

From Genevieve Curtis I had previously been informed of the undertaking. As a matter of fact, I was asked to contact all of our kin in an effort to raise part of the cost, and was told I would be criticized for such a request in my own family, such as my own father, who is buried in Lewisville, has no stone or marker at his grave. I also told Genevieve that President Young was the wealthiest man in the territory for many years and if he had wanted a stone placed at the grave of his dead wife, he would have taken care of it himself. And I still think I am right in that.\\n\\tTomorrow is a presidential election day. I am still a little dubious about how my ballot will be cast. Mr. Truman has made many blunders, has made an ass of himself on a number of occasions and probably is not a smart politician and is not an outstanding leader; but I feel sure he is honest, sincere and has the best interest of his country at heart. Thomas E. Dewey is smart, a clever politician, evades issues, makes no commitments and says nothing that can be termed an out and out statement of his intentions. Then, there may be possible serious reaction to a change of White House policy at this moment; a depression could easily hit. So, I think after due consideration of both men, disregarding the opposite political views, I'll cast my vote for Harry Truman."

Smith was one of the most impressive services I have yet attended. President George Albert Smith was one of the speakers.

I can recall her only on one occasion: it was after Sunday School (of course, I must have seen her many times during my youth, as we grew up in the same town) when I was a kid about 14 or 13. My cousin Will - Dick, as we called him, was with her and was going home with her. She was a pretty girl, with black hair, brown eyes, and olive skin. This is the girl Will should have married and would have married but his father, with a superior air, drew the boy away from her when he thought they were getting serious and sent him on a mission which Dick botched, and botched his entire short spanned life thereafter. He fell under the spell of the womanly wiles of one Esther Burton, in or near Galveston, Texas. He was a fool. He didn't make such an important matter a subject of prayer. In fact, he was a fool because he disobeyed the counsel respecting attachments while serving in the mission field. He was dishonorably released from his mission, came home, brought his bride with him, and nearly broke his parent's hearts.\\n\\tIn a few short years, he had tired of her. She had become the opposite, instead of keeping his interest, she lost it. Soon he began seeking the company of other women. Of his immoral conduct, I know nothing until up to a time say about 1920-21 (he had then been back from his second mission - he having even gone back into the same mission and did a splendid job - about four or five years ago, he went to Provo where he met a girl whose name I do not know. They lived presumably together as man and wife. They had an illegitimate son by him who still lives in Provo, so far as I know, and from a picture I have seen, he is the image of his father.\\n\\tWill died in February 1922 following a tonsillectomy. The wages of sin is death.\\n\\tI had the impression as a lad when I saw them together that Sunday that she was the one for him, and if he had married her, he would be alive today, a stalwart Latter-Day Saint with a home, family, and the respect and love of all who knew him, for Will Selck was the kind of fellow young and old sought after; it was good to be in his company. To me he was an ideal.\\n\\tIn 1919 when his sister, Millie, was married, I went up to Lewisville from Idaho Falls where I was then living. I was a young smart aleck who had taken up the cigarette habit. I recall how disappointed I was when he asked me for a cigarette as we rode along in his car. Of course, I said nothing. I learned the following year that smoking with him was only a minor vice.\\n\\tIt is tragic. Each time I think of him, as I did today after talking with Ileen, who, by the way, is a widow and has been for many years; as I was saying, each time I think of Dick Selck, I am reminded of what could have been and am so terribly sorry about his downfall, as though it had only happened yesterday. Then I say, \"What's the use of crying over spilled milk\" and What's the use of hurting myself by constantly bringing up afresh the panorama of his tragic life. I only hope that sometime, somewhere, I can be of some simple service to him or his children.\\n\\t If I learn one simple lesson from the life of my cousin: obedience and the calamity which may follow disobedience. Probably his first mistake was failing to seriously and prayerfully set out on his mission."

Bore my testimony, thanked my Heavenly Father for His goodness and kindness to me and for the miraculous way He has answered my prayers.\\n\\tI say again tonight - and I leave it on these pages - my Father in Heaven has been very good to me, especially so when I consider my unworthiness and my slothfulness.\\n\\tI am thankful that I was privileged to come into the world when the Gospel is upon the earth, and the holy priesthood; the authority to speak and act for and in behalf of God, the great Elohim, the maker and framer of the universe. Whoever bears the holy priesthood of God is a multiple or a part of God Himself. If we bearers of the priesthood would always think of ourselves as Gods in embryo, as individual parts of God - if I can make myself clear! I say, if we thought ourselves as holy vessels of God, then how could we defile ourselves? How could we be carnal, devilish, unclean? How could we be drunkards, and how could we ignore the Word of Wisdom? How could we be thoughtless of His love and care and turn our backs upon Him? I seek to satisfy our natural lusts. God has said through his servant of old, 'the natural man is an enemy of God.'\\n\\tMy Heavenly Father, I petition thee to remember me, since I am weak and thus among those who need strength and fortitude to keep my feet from forbidden paths. Grant me added strength in every moment when I most need that strength, when I might otherwise fall, being unaware of the nearness of a pitfall. I have a worthy ambition: an ambition to be counted a worthy Latter-Day Saint and to be free from debt, lacking in faith; hear me, Heavenly Father; please show mercy unto thy humble servant, deliver me from debt and help me to be a stalwart, liberal, tolerant, faithful, and obedient saint. I pray in my Redeemer's name: Amen.\\n\\tI am too sleepy to write more tonight. Tomorrow brings another set of long hours."
